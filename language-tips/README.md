Language Tips
=============

Programming languages are like snowflakes. Each one is unique but ultimately they are made from the same components or ideas. As you learn programming you will begin to see the various parallels between the languages. In the end programming is a collection of two things. Data structures and algorithms. The data structures are used to store and describe the data to the computer. The algorithms are used to manipulate, order, and search the data. Using these two basic concepts plus the addition of the language's semantics almost any problem can be solved. When learning programming often new users get stuck on the semantics of the language. Where does a bracket go? What is the control structure for a loop? Or any of these details. Over time these things will seemingly disappear to you as you begin to code.
