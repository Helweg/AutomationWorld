Making life easier
==================

Development tools is a fairly large category. For our purposes we will discuss three sets of tools.

Toolchains
----------

A toolchain are all of the tools that are utilized to build your software. This includes things like [make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/),[libtool](http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/), or [gcc](http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/). This category is highly variable depending upon the languages you are using and what you are trying to accomplish.

IDEs
----

Secondly and probably the most popular type of development tool is an IDE or integrated development environment. These tools are what you will work in everyday while you develop software. An IDE can be as intrusive as you want to your development process. You should use an IDE that enables you to develop faster without getting in your way. Some developers use VI/VIM without any plug-ins or changes to the default install of the tool. Others will use highly customized IDEs with dozens of plug-ins. The choice is generally up to you unless your organization requires the use of a specific IDE.

SCM
---

Lastly we will touch on source control management. Source control management is critical for any developer. SCM manages the lifecycle of your code and it tracks changes as you create your software. It also simplifies the task for working with other developers as well. It simplifies the ability to merge several different developers code together and to track who did which changes over time. It can also be critical to help track the addition of bugs into your code. If you are developing software**ALWAYS** use SCM. You will greatly thank yourself for doing this in the long run. Even small throw away scripts can benefit from using SCM. If you don't use version control and develop code it is the same as not washing your hands after using the restroom.
