Choosing the correct IDE for you!
=================================

An IDE or integrated development environment is a tool that allows you to edit text and provides some easy tools to simplify your development process. Choosing an IDE is a great debate. Each person has a different method they use to develop software. An IDE can enable you to be more effective in your work or if used incorrectly it could become a hinderance. It is best to try out the various tools availble and see which one you like.

In my mind there are a few items that are critical to an IDE:

1.	Syntax Highlighting
	-	Your code should be automatically colored or highlighted. The simple benefit is that you can quickly find errors in the code. It is possible to miss a simple ", ', or . and have it take you a long time to fix. However colored code allows you to easily see if there are mistakes and ultimately makes your life easier to develop.
2.	Code Validation or Linting
	-	As you code you will begin to code you will get good at producing a lot of code in a short period of time. It often becomes numbing to look over code and find errors. A linter validates your code as you save it or even have it auto-formatted. A built in linter goes a step beyond syntax highlighting by validating your code on save.
3.	SCM Integration
	-	All code should be written using a source code management (SCM) tool. It doesn't matter if you use CVS, SVN, or GIT. SCM is critical to track the changes to your code. Almost all IDEs do support this due to the criticality of the feature. Often IDEs will have some additional helpers to identify which files have changed and or offer the built in ability to commit the changes to the repository.
4.	Plug-in architecture
	-	Once you start using a specific language there may be some additional efficences you want to get out of the language. An IDE with a plug-in architecture allows other developers to create tools to further simplify development. This includes but is not limited to automatic formatting, autocomplete for code, code snippets, and really anything you can think of. Odds are if you have a need for a plug-in and the problem is common enough someone has already written a plug-in to help solve your workflow issue.

Atom

The IDE [Atom](http://atom.io) is a free tool (free as in beer) written by Github. It is a very flexible IDE that has great community support and has a plethora of plug-ins available. It takes a unique approach in that it is actually a customized version of the [Chrome Browser](http://www.google.com/chrome/) that is changed to act as a development platform. It has gained a lot of steam since its launch. Currently GitHub offers a Mac and a Linux installable package, but also some users have compiled it for Microsoft Windows as well.

Atom is highly customizable or as GitHub puts it "hackable". This means that every aspect of the IDE can be customized, typically using web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. The community has already created hundreds of plugs for the IDE and it is fairly easy to create your own.
