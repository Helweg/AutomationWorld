Automation Demos
================

This GIT repository contains various automation demos that can be used for Juniper Networks products. Each subdirectroy offers a README.md (Github-flavored Markdown) that describes the capabilities of each demo.

The hierarchy is subject to change in the repo. But the goal is to allow for an easy to navigate set of folders that contain documentation and or code to show the examples clearly.
